This assignment is made in python with pandas

## current problems
Because the current test framework works by having the locker codes 1-12 but because pandas is normal and it does count from 0 this program uses the locker range 0-11. This will be solved somewhere in the near feature

## setup
you first need to create an virtual env by running:
```py
python3 -m venv env
```

then you will need to activate the virtual env by running:
```
source env/bin/activate
```

after you have installed and activated the virtual env
```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

then you can run opdracht.py to test the code
